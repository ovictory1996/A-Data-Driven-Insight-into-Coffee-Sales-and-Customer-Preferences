## INTRODUCTION
Coffee remains one of the most consumed and profitable products globally. Understanding sales patterns, customer preferences, and product performance is essential for companies to remain agile and responsive to consumer demands. This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of coffee sales data, which includes diverse variables such as product type, roast level, country of purchase, customer information, pricing, and sales volume.
By exploring this dataset, we aim to uncover key insights into consumer behavior, identify high-performing products, analyze regional preferences, and detect trends across various coffee types such as Robusta, Arabica, Liberica, and Excelsa. The project leverages data analytics techniques to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence that can support decision-making, marketing strategies, and inventory management.
